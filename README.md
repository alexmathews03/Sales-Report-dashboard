📊 Sales Performance Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard designed to analyze total sales, sales trends, store-wise performance, and province-level revenue distribution.

⭐ Purpose

The Sales Performance Dashboard helps users quickly understand sales performance across months, stores, and regions.
It highlights:

Key KPIs

Store performance

Top-performing provinces

This enables managers to make faster and more informed business decisions.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Built using:

Power BI Desktop – for data modelling & visualization

Power Query – for cleaning, merging, and transforming data

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for YoY%, YTD Sales & KPI calculations

Data Modeling – relationships built between Sales, CustomerMaster, and supporting tables

📂 Data Source

The dashboard uses sales transaction data combined with customer details.

Sales Data → Monthly sales amount, quantity sold, item counts

CustomerMaster.xlsx → Customer + province information

Dataset includes: store types, regions, sales amounts, quantities, YoY% changes, YTD values, and more.
All data was transformed in Power BI to create clean, analysis-ready tables.
